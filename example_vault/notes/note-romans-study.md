# Romans Chapter 8 Study

Key verses for understanding suffering and glory:

- Romans 8:28 - All things work together for good
- Romans 8:28-30 - The golden chain of salvation
- John 17:20-23 - Jesus prays for unity

Cross-reference with Genesis 50:20 (Joseph's story).

## Devotional Thoughts

The promise in Romans 8:28 connects to the broader theme in John 3:16.
